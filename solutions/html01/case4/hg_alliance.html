      <h2>Decide the Fate of the World</h2>
      <p>The world is at war. <strong>Alliance</strong> challenges you 
         and your opponents to decide the outcome. As one of the world powers 
         battling for supremacy you must lead your country's military drive; but 
         you can't do it alone. You have to form alliances and then betray your 
         allies before they betray you!</p>
      <p>Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity of the strike. 
         Will it be a bombing raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion with 
         land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, move into enemy territory with 
         your forces and win the conflict.</p>
      <p>The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. Buy armaments 
         and develop secret weapons from your country's economic funds and natural 
         reserves, but be sure to save something for the future.</p>

         <h1>Tedious and Confusing</h1>
         <p>The list of war simulation games is long. All of them share 
            similar features including the formation of temporary Alliance and 
            battles simulated through random draws of a deck or the roll of the 
            die. <em>Alliance</em> offers very little that is new or innovative 
            in that regard.</p>
         <p>We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
            In fact, I dare say we spent more time reading and rereading the rule 
            book than actually playing the game. If you want to read a book on 
            war, we suggest Sun Tzu.</p>

         <h1>Decent Game but Many are Better</h1>
         <p><em>Alliance</em> is a good war simulation game. We found 
            the game play to be robust and engaging. The rules are long and 
            drawn out but, for anyone with experience in this class of board games, 
            there is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We think the 
            battle simulation cards are some of the best we have encountered.</p>
         <p>All of that being said, the competition for this type of game is 
            fierce. There are a lot of established titles with loyal clients. We're 
            not exactly sure where <em>Alliance</em> fits in with that group. It's a 
            good game, but not good enough to draw our attention away from games 
            like <em>Battle Tested</em> and <em>Global Conflict</em>.</p>

         <h1>Fun and Challenging</h1>
         <p><em>Alliance</em> is fun game and is sure to appeal to war game 
            enthusiasts. We think it offers several new ideas that we're surprised 
            have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and 
            the investment options give the game a "real world" feel.</p>

            <li>Flexible Rules and Setup</li>
            <li>Detail and Historical Accuracy</li>

         </ul>
         <p>Things We Hated</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Long and Complicated Rule Book</li>
            <li>Setup takes too Long</li>
         </ul>
         <p>This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger 
            players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored</p>
