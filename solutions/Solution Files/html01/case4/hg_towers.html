      <h2>Rule an Ancient City</h2>
      <p><strong>Towers and Temples</strong> is the winner of the 2017 Palmer Medal for 
         Best New Simulation Board Game. Players adopt role cards of characters 
         from ancient Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage the administration of 
         a city. Each role provides a different ability and strategy. However, one 
         role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players must be constantly aware 
         of betrayal and double-cross. This card game provides a ton of enjoyment and 
         can handle up to eight players and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>
      <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must carefully choose his 
         or her roles and the strategies can quickly change with the turn of a card. 
         However the level of randomness is just right and cunning and resourcefulness 
         can overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not recommend this game unless there 
         are at least 4 players; less than that reduces the intrigue and some of 
         the game appeal.</p>

         <h1>Highly Recommended</h1>
         <p>Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is just about 
            perfect and each player must carefully choose roles each turn. 
            Even though the strategic possibilities are nearly endless, the 
            game is simple to learn. The replay value is high and gets even 
            better when you replace some of the cards with new cards available 
            in the expansion packs.</p>

         <h1>Great Strategic Board Game</h1>
         <p>We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 to 
            6 players and we can strongly recommend the game. The different phases 
            of the game are interesting and intriguing, from bluffing and 
            stealing to site construction and planning. With the variety of 
            cards and scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
            a great introduction to the world of strategic board games 
            and role playing.</p>

         <h1>An Incredible Game</h1>
         <p>The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent and 
            one of the best around. As for play, this game offers lots of 
            strategy, and there are tough decisions to make every turn. It's 
            not only important to select the character that increases your chances 
            for scoring, but also to anticipate the characters the opponents are 
            likely to select, and then hedge against their availability. This 
            causes a lot of unpredictability and deep strategic thinking. 
            However, it can still be played at a more basic level for 
            younger users.</p>
         <p>We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as <em>Best in its Class</em>. 
            Highly recommended.</p>
